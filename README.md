# IaC/GitOps demo project

In this project I'm using AWS EKS with Terraform.

To avoid unnecessary cloud costs, the infrastructure is **not** actively deployed on AWS.

Tip: The Terraform architecture has been visualized using two different approaches to improve transparency and dependency understanding.
