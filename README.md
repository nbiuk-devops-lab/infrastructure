# IaC/GitOps demo 

This repository contains an example infrastructure setup demonstrating modern DevOps practices using:

- Terraform
- GitOps
- Kubernetes-ready architecture

## Only for demonstration purposes

To avoid unnecessary cloud costs, the infrastructure is not actively deployed on AWS.  
The Terraform and GitOps configuration reflects a realistic, production-oriented setup and can be applied in a real environment.

## Run the app locally
